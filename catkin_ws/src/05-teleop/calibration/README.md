# Package `calibration` {#calibration}

<move-here src='#pkg_name-autogenerated'/>

**TO DO**
⁻ Gracefully stop rosbag recording in compressed_image_to_world_frame.launch, so far requires hard-kill via CTRL+C.
- Bug in compressed_image_to_world_frame: see issues.

**REQUIRED**:

To be able to run the launch file: compressed_image_to_world_frame.launch:

* use local_env.sh which sets the DUCKIEFLEET_ROOT to the default location. Make sure to include your calibration folder at DUCKIEFLEET_ROOT.

* Install the lastest version of the scipy, as the code uses `ivp_solver` that is introduced in scipy version v1.2.0: "pip install scipy"

* pip install pyyaml

* sudo apt-get install python-rospkg

This package is an automatic wheels calibration procedure.

- The launchfile commands.launch sends specific voltage command to the wheels while recording images with the camera in a rosbag.

- The launchfile calibration.launch calculates the different parameters of the theoretical model that fit best the trajectory of the Duckiebot.

- The launchfile test.launch tests if the calibration has succeed or not.


## Data Acquisition

Start camera-related functionality by roslaunching

```shell
roslaunch pi_camera cal_camera.launch veh:=![ROBOT_NAME] cam_param_file_name:=![PARAM_FILE]
```

Then start the data-acquisition interface by

```shell
roslaunch calibration data_collector.launch veh:=![ROBOT_NAME]
```
With this interface can specify

- the type of the experiment you would like to conduct by choosing amongst the presented options,

- whether to save the collected experiment data by answering the question after the experiment has been completed,

- whether to do another experiment.

Note that we can specify the resolution of the images taken with ´![PARAM_FILE]´. This file must be placed under

´/home/software/catkin_ws/src/00-infrastructure/duckietown/config/baseline/pi_camera/camera_node´



´$(duckietown)/config/baseline/pi_camera/camera_node´.

## Calibration  

### Processing Data

The data recorded during the experiment is /compressed_image, but calibration script requires /tag_detections_local_frame. To get a bag file with the correct topic.

```shell
roslaunch calibration compressed_image_to_world_frame.launch veh:=mete input_rosbag:=/home/selcuk/input.bag output_rosbag:=/home/selcuk/![OUTPUT_FILE_NAME].bag operation_mode:=1 custom_resolution:=![WIDTH_HEIGT_OF_IMAGE]
```

Note the `operation_mode` parameters which runs the image processing pipeline in sequential mode.

Also note if you choose to record the bag at a resolution that is different from the custom one (640, 480), you should pass the new resolution for (1440, 1080) as `1440_1080`.

Also note that image processing pipeline requires the calibration files to work correctly, currently the calibration files are look for in their default location, for instance intrinsic calibration file must be located at '![HOME_DIRECTORY]/duckiefleet/calibrations/camera_intrinsic/![ROBOT_NAME].yaml'.

### Optimization

On your local PC, start the optimization

```shell
roslaunch calibration calibration.launch veh:=![ROBOT_NAME] folder_path:=![INPUT_FOLDER_PATH]
```

 Note that the optimization script automatically loads and feeds all the bag files that are located inside ![INPUT_FOLDER_PATH].

## Transfer the calibration YAML files

```shell
scp /home/selcuk/duckiefleet/calibrations/kinematics/mete_kinematic_drive.yaml selcuk@mete:~/
sudo mv ~/mete_kinematic_drive.yaml /data/config/calibrations/kinematics/
```
## Test

Run the test script with
```shell
scp /home/selcuk/duckiefleet/calibrations/kinematics/mete_kinematic_drive.yaml selcuk@mete:~/
sudo mv ~/mete_kinematic_drive.yaml /data/config/calibrations/kinematics/
```

## Development Notes
### Pose estimation from Lane Filter

Develop offline by recording a bag by following the instructions above. Make sure bag contains compressed_image and cam_info. At this point, in case you use a different resolution than the custom one, the readings are expected to be off.

```shell
roslaunch calibration lane_pose.launch veh:=![ROBOT_NAME] local:=true
```

the program will not start until you play the bag, in a separate window

```shell
rosbag play --loop ROSBAG.bag
```

access the pose estiamtes through rostopic

```shell
rostopic echo /![ROBOT_NAME]/lane_filter_node/lane_pose
```

### Getting estimates from both Lane Filter and AprilTags

Note that the input bag is expected to contain cam_info topic as it is required by the Lane Filter.

```shell
roslaunch calibration calculate_poses.launch veh:=![ROBOT_NAME] input_rosbag:=![INPUT_ROSBAG] output_rosbag:=![OUTPUT_ROSBAG] local:=true operation_mode:=1
```

### Post-Processing the recorded bag

Remarks:

maximum allowed resolution to retain the default aspect ratio (4/3) is 1440 * 1080

### Giving Reference velocity and manual tuning of model parameters

This procedure is useful to get a feeling about the reasonable values of each parameter, and can be fed to optimization problem as initial condition.

```shell
roslaunch dagu_car inverse_kinematics_node.launch veh:=mete local:=true model:=sysid
```

publish to car_cmd (reference velocities for car to follow)
rostopic pub /mete/inverse_kinematics_node/car_cmd duckietown_msgs/Twist2DStamped '{header: {}, v: 0.5, omega: 0.05}'


### Notes

If working with old software architecture and install the dependencies in a virtual environment

```shell
virtualenv my_venv
source my_venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy scipy
```

to exit virtual environment

```shell
source my_venv/bin/deactivate
```
